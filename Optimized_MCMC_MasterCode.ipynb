    "# **Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation for Quantum Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a Python-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to study quantum systems. Specifically, it focuses on approximating the ground-state wavefunction and correlation functions for two systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A canonically quantized version of the Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Methodology**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation employs a **discretized path integral formulation** and integrates the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Thermalization**\n",
    "- The system begins in a random or predefined initial configuration.\n",
    "- A thermalization phase ensures that the sampled configurations stabilize, removing any initial biases.\n",
    "- Configurations from this phase are discarded to ensure unbiased sampling in later steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sampling Configurations**\n",
    "- Configurations are updated iteratively based on the Metropolis algorithm.\n",
    "- A **Wick rotation** is applied to transform the action into a Euclidean formulation, enabling a probabilistic interpretation.\n",
    "- Supports different action-modifying strategies, such as squaring or taking the absolute value of the action, to test alternative formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Wavefunction Approximation**\n",
    "- Position samples are accumulated into bins to construct a histogram.\n",
    "- The normalized histogram approximates the probability distribution for the ground-state wavefunction.\n",
    "- This approach reveals the expected Gaussian profile for the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator and potentially complex structures for the FLRW model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Correlation Functions**\n",
    "- The simulation calculates the two-point correlation function between positions at different time points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Customizable Parameters**\n",
    "- **Lattice Spacing (`a`)**: Controls the discretization of the time domain.\n",
    "- **Number of Monte Carlo Steps (`NE`)**: Defines the total number of samples to draw.\n",
    "- **Number of lattice points (`N`)**: Defines the total number of lattice time points. This means that `N*a` decides the total duration of the path.\n",
    "- **Thermalization Steps (`therms`)**: Determines how many steps to discard for stabilization.\n",
    "- **Physical Constants (`M`, `mu`, etc.)**: Include parameters like mass and angular frequency for the QHO or cosmological constants for the FLRW universe.\n"
